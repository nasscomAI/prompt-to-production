## Quick Start

**Step 1 — Fork and clone**
Fork this repo to your GitHub account, then clone your fork locally.

**Step 2 — Create your branch — one branch for the entire session**
Name it exactly:
```bash
git checkout -b participant/[your-name]-[city]
# Example: participant/arshdeep-pune
```

> **One branch. All four UCs. The whole session.**
> Do not create a new branch per UC — all your work goes into this single branch.
> Your commit history is your evidence trail. Tutors read it in chronological order
> to follow your CRAFT loop across UC-0A through UC-X.

**Step 3 — Confirm your environment**
```bash
python --version          # Must be 3.9+
git --version             # Must be installed
python -c "import csv, json; print('Ready')"
```

**Step 4 — Confirm data files are present**
```
data/city-test-files/    test_pune.csv
                         test_hyderabad.csv
                         test_kolkata.csv
                         test_ahmedabad.csv

data/policy-documents/   policy_hr_leave.txt
                         policy_it_acceptable_use.txt
                         policy_finance_reimbursement.txt

data/budget/             ward_budget.csv

## Commit Message Standard

Every commit must follow this format:
```
[UC-ID] Fix [what]: [why it failed] → [what you changed]
```

Good examples:
```
UC-0A Fix severity blindness: no keywords in enforcement → added injury/child/school/hospital triggers
UC-0B Fix clause omission: completeness not enforced → added every-numbered-clause rule
UC-0C Fix silent aggregation: no scope in enforcement → restricted to per-ward per-category only
UC-X  Fix cross-doc blending: no single-source rule → added single-source attribution enforcement
```

Minimum **4 commits** — one per UC — all on the same branch.
Messages like `update`, `done`, `fix`, `wip`, `final` will be flagged during review.

Your commit history tells the story of your CRAFT loop. A reviewer reading it in order
should be able to see: what failed, what you changed, and why — for each UC.
